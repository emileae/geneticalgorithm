# README #

A Genetic Algorithm implementation in C# that intends to be both simple and flexible.

Can be used in all types of C# applications (.NET, Unity, MonoGame, etc).

Methods for serialization have been implemeted, but they are contained in a different branch called "serialization".
The reason for that is because these are not typical features of a genetic algorithm, but they exist if you have interest in them.
You can choose which branch to download by selecting the "Branches" tab in the "Downloads" page.

Developed alongside a series of YouTube video tutorials.
